## Overview

Aegis is a user script designed to help users protect their cognitive sovereignty online by:

- **Behavioral obfuscation**: Simulating human-like randomness to confuse trackers and profiling scripts.  
- **Emotional manipulation detection**: Real-time scanning of webpage content to identify emotional trigger phrases and manipulation tactics.  
- **Severity visualization**: A live status panel with a color-coded severity bar indicating emotional intensity on the page.

---

## Features

- Lightweight, runs in browser via userscript managers like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey  
- Toggle the debug/status panel easily with **Ctrl + Shift + A**  
- Logs detected manipulation triggers and emotional keywords in real-time  
- Monitors dynamic page content with a MutationObserver for ongoing analysis
